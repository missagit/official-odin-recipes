        <h2>Spicy umami heaven</h2>
        <p>Protien packed quick weeknight dish perfect for the cold weather. With a spicy coconut broth, sweet flakey haddock, and bouncy udon noodles, you'd be crazy not try it out.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 spring onions, thinly sliced (reserve some of the greens for garnish)</li>
            <li>2 large garlic cloves, minced</li>
            <li>10g fresh ginger, minced</li>
            <li>1 tbsp gochujang</li>
            <li>1 tbsp fish sauce</li>
            <li>1â€“2 tsp sugar, to taste</li>
            <li>400ml chicken stock</li>
            <li>100ml good-quality coconut milk (minimum 70% coconut extract)</li>
            <li>2 haddock loins (or any flaky white fish fillets)</li>
            <li>2 portions dried or frozen udon noodles (I prefer frozen)</li>
            <li>Chilli oil and/or lime wedges, to serve (optional)</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Method:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Place the spring onions, garlic, ginger, gochujang, fish sauce, sugar, chicken stock, and coconut milk in a medium saucepan.</li>
            <li>Stir to combine, then bring to a simmer over medium-high heat. Cover, reduce the heat to low/medium-low, and let it simmer for 10 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>Add the haddock fillets to the broth, then cover and cook on low/medium-low until the haddock is just cooked through, 3 to 5 minutes depending on thickness.</li>
            <li>Cook the udon noodles according to the package instructions, then drain and divide between bowls.</li>
            <li>Carefully remove the haddock from the broth and flake it into large chunks. Optionally, strain the broth through a sieve for a smoother texture.</li>
            <li>Pour the hot broth over the noodles and top with the flaked fish and reserved spring onion greens. Finish with chilli oil and serve with a lime wedge for extra zing (I prefer it without, but others might enjoy it).</li>
        </ol>
