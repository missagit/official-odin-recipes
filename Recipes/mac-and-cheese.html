        <p>Creamy four cheese baked macaroni pie, perfect for the cold weather</p>

        <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>½ Lb elbow macaron</li>
            <li>1 large egg</li>
            <li>1 12-oz can evaporated milk</li>
            <li>1 C Velveeta, <em>diced</em></li>
            <li>1 C Colby cheese, <em>shredded</em></li>
            <li>1 C Monterey jack cheese, <em>shredded</em></li>
            <li>1 C sharp cheddar cheese, <em>shredded</em></li>
            <li>⅓ C heavy cream</li>
            <li>4 Tbsp salted butter, <em>diced</em></li>
            <li>2 Tbsp sour cream</li>
            <li>½ Tbsp cracked black pepper</li>
            <li>½ Tbsp seasoned salt, to taste</li>
            <li>¼ Tsp cayenne pepper</li>
            <li>1 Tsp ground white pepper
            </li>
            <li>1 Tsp garlic powder</li>
            <li>½ Tsp ground mustard
            </li>
            <li>½ Tsp onion powder</li>
            <li>½ Tsp paprika</li>
            <li>½ Tsp granulated sugar</li>
            <li>⅛ Tsp ground nutmeg</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Method:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Grease your 8x8" square dish and preheat the oven to 350ºF.</li>
            <li>Grate your cheeses and combine together in a large bowl. Cut your butter and 1 C Velveeta into small cubes. Place the butter, velveeta, and half of the shredded cheeses in the prepared dish.</li>
            <li>On your stovetop, cook your ½ Lb elbow macaroni in salted water according to the package directions, just to al dente. While the noodles are boiling, prepare your custard. </li>
            <li>In a large bowl, whisk together the 1 12-oz can evaporated milk, ⅓ C heavy cream, 2 Tbsp sour cream, egg, sugar, and all seasonings except paprika. Beat until totally combined, with no streaks of egg.</li>
            <li>Immediately after draining them, dump the hot noodles into the baking dish. Stir together, letting the noodles start to melt the cheeses. Spread everything around as evenly as possible.</li>
            <li>Sprinkle on a thin layer of cheese, then pour the custard over it.  The liquid should come just to the top of the noodles.
            </li>
            <li>Sprinkle on another layer of cheese, then the ½ Tsp paprika.</li>
            <li>Bake for 40-45 minutes, until golden brown and bubbling at the edges. If the top isn't browned to your liking by 45 minutes, switch the oven to broil for 2-3 minutes, then remove the mac.</li>
            <li>Let it rest for at least 10 minutes before serving. I'm for real: let it rest. Don't touch it! At LEAST ten minutes!
            </li>
        </ol>
