        <strong><h2>Ingredients</h2></strong>
        <em><h3>For the cake:</h3></em>
        <ul>
            <li>½ cup plain yogurt or Greek yogurt</li>
            <li>1 cup granulated sugar</li>
            <li>3 large eggs</li>
            <li>1 ½ cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons baking powder</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>grated lemon zest, <em>from 1 medium-size lemon</em></li>
            <li>½ cup sunflower, <em>grape seed or canola oil</em></li>
        </ul>
        <em><h3>For the glaze:</h3></em>
        <ul>
            <li>¼ cup fresh lemon juice</li>
            <li>¾ cup of powdered sugar</li>
        </ul>
        
        <strong><h2>Method:</h2></strong>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 350˚F (175˚C). Spray an 8-inch round cake pan with baking spray, rub inside surface of pan with a paper towel to cover evenly with the spray. Line bottom of pan with parchment paper and spray parchment paper lightly. Set aside.</li>
            <li>In a large bowl, combine the yogurt, sugar, and eggs - stirring until well blended.</li>
            <li>Add the flour, baking powder, salt and zest, mixing to just combine.</li>
            <li>Add the oil and stir well. Don't worry, at first it will seem to separate, but keep stirring till smooth</li>
            <li>Pour the batter into prepared pan.</li>
            <li>Bake for 30-40 minutes or until the cake feels springy to the touch and a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean (every oven is different, so check with the toothpick test rather than the time). Be careful not to overbake though.</li>
            <li>Cool cake on a wire rack for 10 minutes; then turn it out of the pan onto the rack.</li>
            <li>Combine the lemon juice and powdered sugar in a small bowl and stir until smooth. With a pastry brush, gently pat the glaze all over the cake. Just keep going over the cake till the glaze is gone. Some of it will drip off, but most of it will soak in. Allow cake to cool completely. Sprinkle with powdered sugar if desired and serve.</li>
        </ol>
